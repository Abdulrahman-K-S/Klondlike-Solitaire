The game is played with a standard deck of 52 cards. The cards are dealt face down into seven columns with the first column containing one card, the second column containing two cards, and so on until the seventh column containing seven cards.

The top card of each column is turned face up, and the remaining cards are left face down. The remaining cards are placed in a draw pile, which is located at the top left corner of the screen.

In the tableau columns, cards can be moved onto a card that is one rank higher and of the opposite color. For example, a black seven can be placed on a red eight.

If a column becomes empty, you can move a King to that column to start a new pile.
